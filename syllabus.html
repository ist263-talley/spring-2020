<p><strong>Midterm&nbsp;Exam</strong></p>
<p>This will be a closed book exam. This is used to evaluate your recall and understanding of course material, as well as your ability to apply it to new situations.</p>
<p><strong>Weekly Assignments</strong></p>
<p>Most weeks you will have some form of assignment. It could be summarizing some reading material, and/or writing HTML/CSS/Javascript.
<ul>
<li>Each assignment will be weighted differently.</li>
<li>All weekly assignments are due by Saturday 11:59PM of the week they are assigned.</li>
<li>Assignments should be submitted via Blackboard.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Class Contribution</strong></p>
<p>These 10 points are there to motivate you to do more than just code. To maximize this part of your course grade:
    <ul>
        <li>Attend class<br />
            You can't contribute if you aren't present, so attendance at every class session is expected, including open lab time for project work. Policy for absences:
            <ul>
                <li>Pre-arrange any anticipated absence with the instructor, ideally at least 2 weeks before. This includes athletic team participation and religious observance, per university policy, but also any future medical situations that you know about ahead of time.</li>
                <li>Unanticipated medical situations or other causes: Email preferably 24 hours before class but as soon as you determine you won't attend.</li>
                <li>Up to two absences during the semester are excusable. More will require documentation from a health care provider. After that, class contribution points will be deducted.</li>
                <li>Absent students are responsible for reviewing class readings and slides, and they will need to obtain notes from fellow students who were in attendance.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Ask questions in class</li>
        <li>Respond to others' questions</li>
        <li>Speak up in class to share insightful thoughts and your own perspectives</li>
        <li>Attend office hours</li>
    </ul>
<p><strong>Individual Project</strong></p>
<p>This project will be due after week 14 and will be a culmination of everything learnt from week 1 - 13. You will be required to work parts of it each week starting week 2.</p>
<!--p><strong>SAGE - Self Assessment</strong></p>
<p>SAGE is a required online self-assessment. Each week you’ll answer questions focused on course-related behaviors that I believe are essential for success. Once you’ve done so you’ll be able to see the pattern of your responses in the context of the patterns of others in the class My hope is that this will help you by continuously reminding you of the actions that make for success.<br />
NOTE: NONE of the information submitted in these reports will be used in the determination of your grade - so be honest with yourself and me.</p-->

<p><strong>Technology Requirements</strong></p>
<p>Each of the following technology requirements are mandatory. You must set them up as their use is essential to your grade in the course.</p>
<p><strong>Bring Your Own Device</strong> &mdash; This course uses the BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) model. The expectations are that you own a notebook computer and you will bring it to every class fully charged. If you don’t own a notebook computer you can borrow one from the iSchool using your SUID. You will be expected to install software on your notebook computer. Instructions will be provided.</p>
<p><strong>Integrated Development Environment (IDE)</strong></p>
<p>This course will require the use of an IDE. Visit the <a href="../about/computer-setup.html">instructions and setup page</a> to learn more.</p>
<p><strong>A Strategy for Success</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Do the assigned reading for the week before the week begins.</li>
<li>Master the objectives as you work your way through the reading.</li>
<li>Identify what you don’t understand.</li>
<li>Attend class.</li>
<li>As we go through the material, if you still don’t understand something…ASK A QUESTION!</li>
<li>Take efficient notes.</li>
<li>Do not copy the slides into your notes. They will be made available to you.</li>
<li>Remember key points and <u>why</u> these points are key.</li>
<li>Recognize the thread that weaves these points together.</li>
<li>If you still don’t get something GET HELP. Attend office hours.</li>
<li>Practice the assignments.</li>
<li>Submit assignments ahead of the deadlines. You don't want some Blackboard glitch to cost you points for late submission.</li>
<li>Double-check your Blackboard submission to confirm that everything you think you submitted is present.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>University Attendance Policy</strong></p>
<p>Attendance in classes is expected in all courses at Syracuse University. Students are expected to arrive on campus in time to attend the first meeting of all classes for which they are registered.  Students who do not attend classes starting with the first scheduled meeting may be academically withdrawn as not making progress toward degree by failure to attend. Instructors set course-specific policies for absences from scheduled class meetings in their syllabi.</p>
<p>It is a federal requirement that students who do not attend or cease to attend a class to be reported at the time of determination by the faculty. Faculty should use “ESPR” and “MSPR” in Orange Success to alert the Office of the Registrar and the Office of Financial Aid. A grade of NA is posted to any student for whom the Never Attended flag is raised in Orange SUccess. More information regarding Orange SUccess can be found here, at: <a href="http://orangesuccess.syr.edu/getting-started-2/">http://orangesuccess.syr.edu/getting-started-2/</a></p>
<p>Students should also review the University’s religious observance policy and make the required arrangements at the beginning of each semester.</p>
<a name="su-policies"></a><h3>Syracuse University Policies</h3>
<p>Syracuse University has a variety of other policies designed to guarantee that students live and study in a community respectful of their needs and those of fellow students. Some of the most important of these concerns: 
<p>Diversity and Disability (ensuring that students are aware of their rights and responsibilities in a diverse, inclusive, accessible, bias-free campus community) can be found here, at <a href="https://www.syracuse.edu/life/accessibilitydiversity/">https://www.syracuse.edu/life/accessibilitydiversity/</a></p>
<p>Religious Observances Notification and Policy (steps to follow to request accommodations for the observance of religious holidays) can be found here, at: <a href="http://supolicies.syr.edu/studs/religious_observance.htm">http://supolicies.syr.edu/studs/religious_observance.htm</a></a></p>
<p>Orange SUccess (tools to access a variety of SU resources, including ways to communicate with advisors and faculty members) can be found here, at: <a href="http://orangesuccess.syr.edu/getting-started-2/">http://orangesuccess.syr.edu/getting-started-2/</a></p>
<p><strong>Disability-Related Accommodations:</strong></p>
<p>Syracuse University values diversity and inclusion; we are committed to a climate of mutual respect and full participation. There may be aspects of the instruction or design of this course that result in barriers to your inclusion and full participation in this course. I invite any student to meet with me to discuss strategies and/or accommodations (academic adjustments) that may be essential to your success and to collaborate with the Office of Disability Services (ODS) in this process.</p>
<p>If you would like to discuss disability-accommodations or register with ODS, please visit their website at http://disabilityservices.syr.edu./ Please call (315) 443-4498 or email disabilityservices@syr.edu for more detailed information.</p>
<p>ODS is responsible for coordinating disability-related academic accommodations and will work with the student to develop an access plan. Since academic accommodations may require early planning and generally are not provided retroactively, please contact ODS as soon as possible to begin this process.</p>
<p><strong>Academic Integrity Policy</strong></p>
<p>Syracuse University’s Academic Integrity Policy reflects the high value that we, as a university community, place on honesty in academic work. The policy defines our expectations for academic honesty and holds students accountable for the integrity of all work they submit. Students should understand that it is their responsibility to learn about course-specific expectations, as well as about university-wide academic integrity expectations. The policy governs appropriate citation and use of sources, the integrity of work submitted in exams and assignments, and the veracity of signatures on attendance sheets and other verification of participation in class activities. The policy also prohibits students from submitting the same work in more than one class without receiving written authorization in advance from both instructors. Under the policy, students found in violation are subject to grade sanctions determined by the course instructor and non-grade sanctions determined by the School or College where the course is offered as described in the Violation and Sanction Classification Rubric. SU students are required to read an online summary of the University’s academic integrity expectations and provide an electronic signature agreeing to abide by them twice a year during pre-term check-in on MySlice.</p>
<p><strong>Discrimination or Harassment</strong></p>
<p>The University does not discriminate and prohibits harassment or discrimination related to any protected category including creed, ethnicity, citizenship, sexual orientation, national origin, sex, gender, pregnancy, disability, marital status, age, race, color, veteran status, military status, religion, sexual orientation, domestic violence status, genetic information, gender identity, gender expression or perceived gender.</p>
<p>Any complaint of discrimination or harassment related to any of these protected bases should be reported to Sheila Johnson-Willis, the University’s Chief Equal Opportunity & Title IX Officer. She is responsible for coordinating compliance efforts under various laws including Titles VI, VII, IX and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. She can be contacted at Equal Opportunity, Inclusion, and Resolution Services, 005 Steele Hall, Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY 13244-1120; by email: titleix@syr.edu; or by telephone: 315-443-0211.</p>
<p>Federal and state law, and University policy prohibit discrimination and harassment based on sex or gender (including sexual harassment, sexual assault, domestic/dating violence, stalking, sexual exploitation, and retaliation).</p>
<p>If a student has been harassed or assaulted, they can obtain confidential counseling support, 24-hours a day, 7 days a week, from the Sexual and Relationship Violence Response Team at the Counseling Center (315-443-4715, 200 Walnut Place, Syracuse, New York 13244-5040). Incidents of sexual violence or harassment can be reported non-confidentially to the University’s Title IX Officer (Sheila Johnson Willis, 315-443-0211, titleix@syr.edu, 005 Steele Hall). Reports to law enforcement can be made to the University’s Department of Public Safety (315-443-2224, 005 Sims Hall), the Syracuse Police Department (511 South State Street, Syracuse, New York, 911 in case of emergency or 315-435-3016 to speak with the Abused Persons Unit), or the State Police (844-845-7269).</p>
<p>I will seek to keep information you share with me private to the greatest extent possible, but as a professor I have mandatory reporting responsibilities to share information regarding sexual misconduct, harassment, and crimes I learn about to help make our campus a safer place for all.</p>
<p><strong>Course evaluations</strong></p>
