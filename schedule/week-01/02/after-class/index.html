    <h2>Build Your Resume</h2>
<p>Week 01 homework involves a two-step process:
<ol>
<li>Prepare <strong>your resume</strong> in MS Word, Pages, or another word processing package of your choice.</li>
<li>Save as plain text or copy-paste in Notepad or another text editor software and save from there. You can also copy-paste in VS Code and save-as plain text.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>The goal is to have a plain text file (filename extension: <u>.txt</u>) that you can use in a later exercise to format as HTML for web display. If you already have a resume &mdash; then great! Just open it, make any updates for activity since you last opened the file, and save, then save-as plain text. If you don't have one ready, it's high time that you did!</p>

</ul>
</p>
<h3>Guidelines</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Skip the fancy formatting:</strong> Word and other programs provide all kinds of elaborate layouts for resumes, and you can use one of them if you like, but the formatting will be lost in the conversion to .txt.</li>
<li><strong>Think about structure:</strong> When you start to lay out your resume in HTML, what levels of headings will you use? How will you use lists (both ordered/numbered and unordered/bulleted lists)? What other elements will you include? How will you organize all of them?</li>
<li><strong>Leave thoughts about styling until later:</strong> Stay focused on how the layout will function, not about fonts, colors, and other visual effects. Those can come along later.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Thought for the Week's Class Summary</h2>
<p>Why do you suppose I chose to use ordered (numbered) and unordered (bulleted) lists where I did above?</p>
